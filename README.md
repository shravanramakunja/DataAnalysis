# Movie Data Analysis and Visualization

This project contains data analysis and visualization of a movie database using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Files
- `DataVisualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data analysis and visualization of the movie dataset.
- `mymoviedb.csv`: Dataset containing movie information such as release date, title, overview, popularity, vote count, vote average, genre, and more.

## Getting Started
1. Open `DataVisualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (see Requirements below).
3. Run the notebook cells to explore, clean, and visualize the movie data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

You can install the required packages using:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Project Description
This project explores and visualizes a movie dataset. The notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and inspecting the dataset (`mymoviedb.csv`)
- Data cleaning (removing unnecessary columns, handling dates, removing duplicates, and cleaning genres)
- Statistical analysis (summary statistics, mean, max, min, etc.)
- Visualization of trends and insights using Python libraries
